# heart_disease_classification

The goal of this study is to develop classification models for heart disease prediction and inference that accurately identifies individuals at risk of developing the condition. We will utilize the CDC's BRFSS 2021 dataset to do our research. We plan to optimize for recall so that the true positive rate is high, meaning those who are sick are identified as often as possible. Leveraging relevant health and demographic data, the model will assist healthcare professionals in targeting preventive measures, enhancing patient outcomes, and reducing the overall burden of heart disease on the healthcare system.
