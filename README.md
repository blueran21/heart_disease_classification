## Problem Statement
The goal of this study is to develop classification models for heart disease prediction and inference that accurately identifies individuals at risk of developing the condition. We will utilize the CDC's BRFSS 2021 dataset to do our research. We plan to optimize for recall so that the true positive rate is high, meaning those who are sick are identified as often as possible. Leveraging relevant health and demographic data, the model will assist healthcare professionals in targeting preventive measures, enhancing patient outcomes, and reducing the overall burden of heart disease on the healthcare system.


## Data Cleaning
First, we need to use domain knowledge to identify and remove any irrelevant or redundant columns from the dataset. Then, consult the Dataset Dictionary to properly handle missing values. If a missing value represents a specific category such as 'Not Sure' or 'Missing', rather than being truly missing, replace it accordingly.

## Data Preprocessing
For the categorical columns, we applied one-hot encoding to transform them into a format for different classification models. Additionally, we utilized standard scaling to scale the data, ensuring that all features are on a similar scale. With these preprocessing steps, the dataset is now optimally prepared for building models.
